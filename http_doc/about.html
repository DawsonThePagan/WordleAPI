            <a href="index.html">Back to Game</a>
            <p>This wordle game uses a rust axum backend to run</p>
            <p>This was made to allow me to understand how to make basic APIs in rust</p>
            <p>This entire site is hosted in rust, this HTML was delivered by axum</p>
            <p>I do know that is not the best way of doing things but it works for this simple project</p>
